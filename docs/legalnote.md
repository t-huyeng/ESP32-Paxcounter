# Legal note

**Depending on your country's laws it may be illegal to sniff wireless networks for MAC addresses. Please check and respect your country's laws before using this code!**

# Privacy disclosure

Paxcounter generates identifiers for sniffed Wifi or Bluetooth MAC adresses and and collects them temporary in the device's RAM for a configurable scan cycle time (default 60 seconds). After each scan cycle the collected identifiers are cleared. Identifiers are generated by using the last 2 bytes of universal MAC adresses. Personal MAC adresses remain untouched and are not evaluated. Identifiers and MAC adresses are never transferred to the LoRaWAN network. No persistent storing of MAC adresses, identifiers or timestamps and no other kind of analytics than counting are implemented in this code. Wireless networks are not touched by this code, but MAC adresses from wireless devices as well within as not within wireless networks, regardless if encrypted or unencrypted, are sniffed and processed by this code.
